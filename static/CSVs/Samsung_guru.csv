Phone went through the entire washing process and is working just fine after drying!!! Hats off to the designers. Do I need to mention anymore about the durability.. ha ...haOnly one problem which I felt from day one was the charging pin type is proprietary. Normally all phones available today are usb type however you will have to carry this charger everywhere you go. Otherwise, Voice quality and audio is all good. Battery life is generally 3 days."

"Samsung Guru FM Plus (SM-B110E/D, Black)",Swapnil Dubey,1449.0,3,Not According to Expectation!!!,  It's a good phone. As a basic phone I was expecting more but then Ok. Battery last for almost two days if fully charged but only when you use it for calls. If you use FM then it doesn't even last for few hours. And my set has problem of lagging. I wan't expecting something like this from a basic phone. When I disconnect the call the screen gets still and I can't use it further so I have to restart it. It has happened like 3-4 times in past few days. Voice quality and FM is good. It is handy and keypad is comfortable.

"Samsung Guru FM Plus (SM-B110E/D, Black)",amrita,1449.0,1,Samsung is a cheat,"  Stopped working in barely 2 months, customer service is so bad that they are asking to spend rs. 1000 for repairing even under warranty only a stupid person will spend 1000 rs on rs. 1400 phone"
"Samsung Guru FM Plus (SM-B110E/D, Black)",Gauri A.,1449.0,5,Excellent battery life and sound quality.,"  Got this phone for my mother who is in her 70s. She finds it easy to use, the call sound and ringtones are easy for her to hear. Battery stays for 4 to 5 days once charged depending on the usage. If you are looking for a user friendly phone for senior citizens with a good battery life then go for it. Needless to say, packing and delivery by Amazon was spot on."
